# marge-bot

## Build Instructions.
1. Clone this to any directory.
2. Ensure npm and node.js are installed: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
3. Create your own discord bot for your own server: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html
4. Create an auth.json, input a "token" field. It should look like:
```
{
"token": "{Bot Token}"
